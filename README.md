### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer based out of Winnipeg, Canada. Most of my professional
work is in application architecture and backend development with Java, but I
also work with Typescript and Golang.

- I love learning in public, and put much of what I know into [my
  wiki](https://wiki.brianturchyn.net)
  ([repo](https://github.com/b-turchyn/wiki)).
- I write occasionally on [my personal website](https://brianturchyn.net).
- I'm a big fan of ortholinear keyboards and share [my
  keymaps](https://github.com/b-turchyn/keymaps).
- You can find me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@btwritescode). Share
  with me what you've learned!
